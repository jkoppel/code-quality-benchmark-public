In addition to booking a room in their booking, someone may include one of the following resources in their booking: speakers, document cameras, and laptop carts. There are only 2 of each resource. When a resource has been fully booked for an allotted time, it cannot be booked any more.

Aim to change as little code as possible when implementing these features.
