Create a React room-booking app. Users may browse a list of rooms, and may view when a room is available (in increments of 1 hour), and may book a room any time when it is not already booked. Their booking should contain their name and the time it should be booked for.

Hardcode that there are 5 rooms: Anaconda, Baboon, Ballroom 1, Ballroom 2, and Ballroom 3.
In addition, someone may book the Grand Ballroom, which results from joining all 3 ballrooms.


Configure it so that running `npm run start -- --port=$PORT` opens the app in a browser window with port $PORT.
Pay attention to code quality, as you will be evaluated on how many lines must be changed to add new features.
Do not implement any more features than you have been asked.
