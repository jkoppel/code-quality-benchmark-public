Extend the todo list app to support the following features:

* Assigning more statuses to todo items, in addition to the existing done/not-done (e.g.: in-progress, under review, blocked)
* Assign priorities to todo items
* Adding due dates to todo items

Aim to change as little code as possible when implementing these features.
