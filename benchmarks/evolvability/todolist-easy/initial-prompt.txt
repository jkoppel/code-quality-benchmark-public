Create a React todo list app where you can add, remove, and edit tasks. In the basic version, a task is either done or not done. A user should be able to create and delete todo items, view the TodoList, and mark items as done. 


Configure it so that running `npm run start -- --port=$PORT` opens the app in a browser window with port $PORT.
Pay attention to code quality, as you will be evaluated on how many lines must be changed to add new features.
Do not implement any more features than you have been asked.
