Scoring rubric
* if functional bug in program, score 0 for the completion
  * If the refactored program itself doesn't work, the score is 0 right away
* If not a functional bug, then score is 300 - diff size

Why 300?
* Thought that the tasks could be done within 300 loc
* For the hackathon at least, wanted a score where higher is better

We only care about functional bugs; so, e.g., we ignore UI bugs (eg white text on white background)
