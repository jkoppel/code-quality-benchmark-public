So it didn't actually run at first. Got a "React not found" error. But I decided to pass it, as a build issue rather than a functional issue. Fixing required installing vite and adding a vite config.

UI was a bit weird at first, but it worked perfectly. Fully functional, though not pleasant to use. Diff sizes are implausibly low, and yet they all work.

The Codex completions don't let you assign multiple resources to a room, but the prompt does say "one of," so that's acceptable even though not intended.
