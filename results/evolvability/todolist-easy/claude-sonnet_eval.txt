Raw score: 561

The Sonnet completions were garish, sometimes with white-on-white text, and had the duplicated checkbox. But they were functional. State synched perfectly.

The 3 Codex completions also had the duplicated checkbox, but only codex-3 had proper synch between the checkbox and the status dropdown.

Invalidating codex-1 and codex-2.

Final score: 197
